Case 3: PRODSUP-003:

Dear customer support,

I need to explain how CircleCI works to my boss. I’ve read the docs but I still don’t get it. Can you please explain to me, in your own words, how CircleCI works? Also, it seems like you don’t support .NET builds. Why is that?

Dear Adam,

CircleCI is the tool for continuous integration with automated test support. It's created to make development test and delivery process easier. When you are ready with your changes on gitHub CircleCI automatically runs all your configured tests for your project. Also there is possibility of automatic deployment if tests succeed. So we do all your routine work. 
  CircleCI is very universal environment and for most standard projects it works just out of the box. If your project requires any special setup there is very easy way to tune even the most complicated cases.
  We support most popular platforms and technologies. We currently serve 2 mobile platforms and 7 web languages. We always improve our service and work on new features all the time. Please check for updates on our site, we will support .NET also soon.

All information is always available on the site https://circleci.com/docs

Kindly yours,
