Case 1: PRODSUP-001:

Hi. I am trying to get my test cases to show up on CircleCI but it is not working. I have a fork of this project in my github account https://github.com/mtedone/podam. I added the project to CircleCI and got a green build but the Test Results tab is empty

1) setup git account and new repos -1h 
  - i've lost verification app to old account. I took to long trying to recower the account. So new account was created.
2)setup circleci.com account and connect account.
  - it tourned out that git repo must exists first
3)Fork of https://github.com/mtedone/podam
4)Run tests on circleci.
  - test is green
  - results is empty
  +fault reproduced
  
5) try to find out what was expected.
