1) setup git and circleCI
2) fork the branch
3) connect circleCI and run test
4) check results
6) check if circle.yml is case sensitive
7) circle.yml is faulty. Project runs without it.
8) looks like user's test does not reproduce any artifacts
and 
test:
 post:
   - mkdir -p $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/
   - find . -type f -regex ".*/target/surefire-reports/.*xml" -exec cp {} $CIRCLE_TEST_REPORTS/junit/ \;

gives no result
