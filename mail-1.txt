Case 1: PRODSUP-001:


Hi. I am trying to get my test cases to show up on CircleCI but it is not working. I have a fork of this project in my github account https://github.com/mtedone/podam. I added the project to CircleCI and got a green build but the Test Results tab is empty

Hi Harry,

I've checked your issue and it sounds not clear for me.
Please check (expand) "$ mvn integration-test" section. At the end it's stated that "Tests run: 183, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0"

What do you mean "Results tab is empty" ?
Did you receive a mail with results from builds@circleci.com ?
What browser do you use ?
What result you expect ?
Does your test generates xml reports in */target/surefire-reports/ folder when you run tests localy?

BTW: CircleCI is case-sensitive and if you want to have custom test execution you should rename your file Circle.yml to circle.yml.

BR,Oleh
